If you wish to change something here, message me. Things here are so not customizable
because I know I can change them at any time, but I don't want to limit that ability to YOU.
Just start a discussion/issue (if a constant can't be changed)/PR, and I'll probably do it.
You don't even need to start a PR for me to change something. Just say it :)
