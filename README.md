NOTE: If you wish for anything to be changed, message me. Things here are so not customizable
because I know I can change them at any time, but I don't want to limit that to YOU. Just
start a discussion/issue (if a constant can't be changed)/PR, and I'll probably do it.
To clarify, you don't even need to start a PR for me to change something.
